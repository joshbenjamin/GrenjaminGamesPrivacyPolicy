Welcome to Solar Roller! This privacy policy is intended to inform you about how we handle any data in relation to our game available on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Our game is designed to respect your privacy and comply with legal requirements.

Data Collection and Use
We do not collect any personal data from our users. Our game can be downloaded and played without any need for registration or provision of personal details.

However, we use Google AdMob for serving ads within the game. We do not control the data collection practices of Google AdMob. For more information about what data Google collects and how it is used, please refer to Google’s privacy policy.

Ad Customization
Google AdMob may use data to provide personalized ads. If personalized ads are served, users will have the option to control ad personalization through their device settings as per Google’s guidelines.

Compliance with Advertising Guidelines
We comply with the privacy guidelines set by both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. This includes obtaining user consent where required, especially under regulations like the GDPR for users in the European Union.

Data Security
As we do not collect personal data, the focus on data security is primarily on ensuring the integrity of the game’s code and preventing unauthorized access or manipulation.

User Consent for Ads
For users in regions governed by GDPR, we will obtain explicit consent for showing ads when the game is first launched.

COPPA Compliance
Our game is intended for all age groups. We are committed to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Users are advised that Google AdMob handles data collection for users under the age of 13 according to its own privacy practices.
